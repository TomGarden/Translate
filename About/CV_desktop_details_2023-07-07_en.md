I've been fascinated by C++ for a while , then I noticed your company's position




## Which project help you grow up . 

I think the start-up company `Bee Colony Technology Company` , 
it's SaaS project FullClass app make me grow up .

I mean is , FullClass make me hold the whole things . 
I build the project form 0 to 1 , I build many modules , 
This modules togther make the project . 
That is it's help for me . 

The job , I just reuse myself android develop skill . 

If i have to say that i have done a good thing. 
I think it is i resisting the pressure . 
Because the job is very stressful . 

for the job , my advantage is i can resisting the pressure . 
              my Weakness is i don't like pressure . 

## Reason for leaving
1. on some position , i think i con't learn more  or maybe i no chance grou up to stroger . 
    I will left . 
2. another reason is , if two job are seem same , i select the more rewards one . 


## Why select us 
Why? 
maybe , i whant make my english is more good . 
    on the work , every day i got 8 hours toghter with eng . 
    on the same time , i can write code . 
    That's great . 
Another reason , I whant remote work , that make me more focused .
